# multi-exotic-option-pricer

## **Overview**

This project serves as my first multi-file project and my first experience using GitHub for version control. I've been looking for a pricer like this for a long time, but I couldn't find a free tool that could both price exotic options and display Greeks in a clear and interactive way.  

The goal of this project is to develop a structured and efficient framework capable of:  

- **Pricing** a wide range of financial derivatives, from standard vanilla options (European calls/puts) to more complex exotic structures such as barrier, digital, basket, and Asian options.  
- **Computing and visualizing key risk sensitivities (Greeks)**, including first-order measures like Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, and Rho, as well as second-order sensitivities like Vanna and Volga.  
- **Implementing various quantitative pricing techniques**, from closed-form models (Black-Scholes) to stochastic methods like Monte Carlo simulations and numerical approaches such as binomial and trinomial trees.  

The project is entirely written in **Python**, using **Streamlit** to create a simple and interactive interface. While primarily designed as a personal learning tool, it could also serve as a useful starting point for further exploration of option pricing and risk analysis.
